# larkysArmorRebalance
A fairly simple armor rebalance.
The overall goal is to increase the number of viable armors at every tier.
Buffs most armors belt slots as any armor without 4-5 slots is useless late game.
Buffs most SEVAs anomaly and radiation protections.
Buffs some faction SEVAs (CS-4a Pathfinder)  to be armored SEVAs similar to mercenary ACE and Pathfinder, these all require heavy toolkits.

armored and unarmored SEVA suits are now about 10% less durable against gunfire
skat9 and IBA suits are now about 15% more durable against gunfire
exoSuits are now 20% more durable against gunfire.
